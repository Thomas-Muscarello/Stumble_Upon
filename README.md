# Stumble_Upon
Stumble Upon is a CLI app that uses an API to help the user find a brewery by name, city, and type.
Stumble Upon also takes in the users information and creates a profile for them. The user can then view their profile.

To begin you will open the by:

The app will ask you to enter a username, the city you are most near, and then your favorite style of beer.
once this information is entered, you will then be able to search for breweries.
To submit a command, you must enter the proper number, followed by enter.
for example: If you wanted to view your profile, you would type "4" then press enter.

This is an entry level app.
To exit the application, you will need to press "5" and enter.
